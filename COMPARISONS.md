# Code Comparison: This Repository vs. LLMs-from-scratch

This document provides a detailed comparison between the code in this repository and the code from the standalone Gemma3 notebook in the [rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch) repository. Specifically, the comparison is with the following file:

- [ch05/12_gemma3/standalone-gemma3.ipynb](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/blob/main/ch05/12_gemma3/standalone-gemma3.ipynb)

While both repositories implement a similar Gemma-style transformer model, they have different goals and structures. This repository is structured as a modular Python project, while the LLMs-from-scratch notebook is a self-contained, educational resource.

## Overall Structure

The most significant difference between the two repositories is their overall structure.

**This Repository:**
- **Modular Project:** The code is organized into a collection of Python modules, each with a specific purpose:
    - `model.py`: Defines the main `Gemma3Model` class.
    - `layers.py`: Contains the building blocks of the transformer, such as `GroupedQueryAttention` and `TransformerBlock`.
    - `normalization.py`: Implements the `RMSNorm` layer.
    - `rope.py`: Implements the Rotary Positional Embeddings.
    - `tokenizer.py`: Handles the tokenizer loading and chat template.
    - `config.py`: Stores the model configurations.
- **Dedicated Scripts:** It includes separate, runnable scripts for training and inference:
    - `train_from_scratch.py`: A complete script for training the model on a dataset.
    - `inference_custom.py`: A script for loading a trained model and generating text.

**LLMs-from-scratch Notebook:**
- **Single File:** All the code, including the model definition, helper functions, and usage examples, is contained within a single Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file.
- **Educational Flow:** The notebook is structured as a step-by-step guide, with explanations and code cells that are meant to be executed in order. It's designed for learning and experimentation in an interactive environment.

## Model Implementation

The core implementation of the Gemma-style model is very similar in both repositories. They both correctly implement the key architectural features of Gemma 3.

**Similarities:**
- **Core Architecture:** Both models use the same fundamental components:
    - `RMSNorm` for normalization.
    - `GroupedQueryAttention` for the attention mechanism.
    - Rotary Positional Embeddings (`RoPE`).
    - A SwiGLU-like feed-forward network.
- **Functionality:** The `Gemma3Model` class in both repositories has a `forward` pass and a `generate` method for autoregressive text generation.
- **Weight Loading:** Both include a utility function (`load_weights_into_gemma`) to load pre-trained weights from a dictionary-like object into the model.

**Differences:**
- **Code Organization:** As mentioned, this repository's model is split into multiple files (`model.py`, `layers.py`, etc.), while the notebook has all classes in one place.
- **Docstrings and Comments:** The code in this repository generally has more extensive docstrings and inline comments, explaining the purpose of each class, method, and key line of code.
- **Naming Conventions:** There are minor differences in variable names (e.g., `cfg` vs. `param_config`).
- **`forward` Method:** The `forward` method in this repository's `model.py` can optionally compute and return the loss, which is useful for training. The notebook's `forward` method only returns the logits.

## Data Loading and Training

This is a major point of divergence, as this repository is set up for training a model from scratch, while the notebook focuses on demonstrating the model architecture with pre-trained weights.

**This Repository (`train_from_scratch.py`):**
- **Full Training Loop:** Provides a complete training script that includes:
    - An `AdamW` optimizer.
    - A learning rate scheduler with warmup and cosine decay.
    - A `torch.amp.GradScaler` for mixed-precision training.
    - Gradient accumulation.
    - A training and validation loop with loss estimation.
- **Data Handling:** Implements a custom data loading pipeline:
    - It uses the `datasets` library to download data (e.g., TinyStories).
    - It tokenizes the data and saves it to a binary file using `numpy.memmap`. This is an efficient way to handle large datasets that don't fit into RAM.
    - The `get_batch` function reads random chunks from the memory-mapped file to create batches for training.

**LLMs-from-scratch Notebook:**
- **No Training Code:** The notebook does not contain a training loop, optimizer, or data loading pipeline for training.
- **Focus on Inference:** Its primary goal is to demonstrate how to load the pre-trained Gemma 3 weights from Hugging Face and use the model for text generation.

## Inference Process

Both repositories provide code for generating text, but the implementation and tokenization approach differ.

**This Repository (`inference_custom.py`):**
- **Standalone Script:** Inference is handled by a dedicated `inference_custom.py` script, which loads a saved model checkpoint (`.pt` file) and generates text from a list of prompts.
- **Tokenization:** This script uses the `tiktoken` library (specifically, the GPT-2 tokenizer) for encoding the input prompts and decoding the output tokens. This is a deliberate choice to demonstrate the model with a different tokenizer than the one it was pre-trained with.
- **Generation Function:** The `generate` function is part of the `Gemma3Model` class and includes options for `top_k` sampling and `temperature` scaling.

**LLMs-from-scratch Notebook:**
- **Notebook Cells:** Inference is performed in the final cells of the notebook.
- **Tokenization:** It uses the official Gemma 3 tokenizer, downloaded from Hugging Face, by wrapping the `tokenizers` library. It also includes a helper function to apply the Gemma chat template.
- **Generation Function:** The notebook provides a `generate_text_basic_stream` function that uses `torch.argmax` for greedy decoding and yields tokens one by one (streaming).

## Configuration

Both repositories use Python dictionaries to store the model's hyperparameters.

**This Repository (`config.py`):**
- **Centralized Configuration:** All model configurations are stored in a dedicated `config.py` file. This makes it easy to manage multiple configurations (e.g., `GEMMA3_CONFIG_CUSTOM`, `GEMMA3_CONFIG_270M`) and import them into other scripts.

**LLMs-from-scratch Notebook:**
- **In-line Configuration:** The model configuration is defined in a dictionary within a code cell, directly before the model is initialized. This is suitable for a self-contained notebook but less scalable for a larger project with multiple models or experiments.

## Conclusion

In summary, both repositories provide excellent implementations of a Gemma-style model, but with different objectives:

- **This repository** is structured as a reusable, modular project that is well-suited for training models from scratch and running experiments in a more traditional software development environment.
- **The LLMs-from-scratch notebook** is a fantastic educational resource, designed to teach the concepts of the Gemma 3 architecture in a clear, linear, and interactive way.

The choice between them would depend on the user's goal: to have a project to build upon, or to learn the inner workings of the model in a self-contained environment.
